## Project Overview

The Fictitious Web Application is an online platform built with a microservices architecture that offers various services, including user authentication, payment processing, content management, and user interactions. This repository contains the comprehensive test plan and detailed test scenarios designed to ensure the application's functionality, performance, security, and usability.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy embraces DevOps practices and emphasizes shifting testing left to detect defects early in the development lifecycle. It involves unit testing, integration testing, API testing, performance testing, security testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), exploratory testing, and continuous monitoring.

## Test Types and Activities

- **Unit Testing**: Developers write unit tests for microservices to ensure individual component functionality.
- **Integration Testing**: Automated tests validate interactions between microservices and end-to-end scenarios.
- **API Testing**: API endpoints are tested for correctness in request/response formats and error handling.
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter is used to simulate user loads and measure system performance.
- **Security Testing**: Automated tools and manual reviews identify vulnerabilities across microservices.
- **UAT**: Collaborative testing in staging environments with stakeholders to ensure user satisfaction.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Testers explore the application to identify usability issues and defects.

## Test Environments

- **Development Environment**: Developers work in local environments with version control and CI tools.
- **Staging Environment**: Resembles production conditions for continuous testing and validation.

## Defect Tracking

- Defects are reported in a standardized format.
- Continuous communication between testers and developers during defect resolution.

## Test Deliverables

- Test cases and scenarios for each test type.
- Automated test scripts for various testing activities.
- Test reports with results, metrics, and identified defects.
- UAT results and feedback from stakeholders.

## Test Schedule

1. Ongoing unit and integration tests during development.
2. Parallel API and security testing with development sprints.
3. Performance testing at major release milestones.
4. UAT conducted before production deployment.

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Microservices Integration**: Rigorous integration testing to identify communication failures.
- **Data Consistency**: Implement data synchronization and consistency checks.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security testing and prompt patching.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Continuous performance testing and optimization.

## Unit Testing Scenarios

- Verify user authentication microservice validates user credentials correctly.
- Test payment processing microservice for accurate transaction amount calculation.
- Validate content management microservice's ability to store and retrieve content.
- Test input validation boundaries in different microservices.

## Integration Testing Scenarios

- Verify user authentication microservice interacts correctly with payment processing for successful transactions.
- Test integration between content management and user authentication for secure content access.
- Validate user interactions involving multiple microservices.

## API Testing Scenarios

- Validate API endpoints for user registration and login, ensuring correct status codes and response formats.
- Test payment processing API endpoints for accurate payment validation and processing.
- Validate API contract for content management, including request and response formats.

## Performance Testing Scenarios

- Simulate high concurrent user logins to assess authentication performance.
- Test payment processing microservice under load to measure transaction processing times and resource utilization.
- Measure response time and resource usage during content retrieval from the content management microservice.

## Security Testing Scenarios

- Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in user input fields across microservices.
- Verify proper implementation and security of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the microservices.

## User Acceptance Testing Scenarios

- Register, login, and update profiles to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Test payment processing to ensure accurate transactions and notifications.
- Interact with content management features to validate user-friendly functionality.

## Exploratory Testing Scenarios

- Explore user registration process for usability and intuitive flow.
- Interact with payment processing to identify unexpected behavior.
- Explore content management features to identify usability issues.
